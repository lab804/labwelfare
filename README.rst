The purpose of this package is to calculate the heat load index of the various
genotypes using the method proposed by Gaugh, besides offering a calculation 
to find the value of the temperature in the black globe in which is essential 
for the method proposed by Gaugh, other utilities as risk index, alerting, 
reporting with historical analysis of pens.

Features
--------

* Calculate HLI (Heat Load Index)
* Calculate HLI based on Air temperature and solar radiation
* Shows risk at five degrees (negligible, low, medium, high and extreme)
