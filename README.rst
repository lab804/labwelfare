The purpose of this package is to calculate the heat load index of the various
genotypes using the method proposed by Gaugh, besides offering a calculation 
to find the value of the temperature in the black globe in which is essential 
for the method proposed by Gaugh, other utilities as risk index. , alerting, 
reporting with historical analysis of pens.

Features
--------

* Calculate HLI (Heat Load Index)
* Calculate HLI based on Air temperature and solar radiation
* Shows risk at five degrees (negligible, low, medium, high and extreme)
